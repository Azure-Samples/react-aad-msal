# React AAD MSAL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure-Samples/react-aad-msal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure-Samples/react-aad-msal)

React AAD MSAL is a library to easily integrate the Microsoft Authentication Library with Azure Active Directory in your React app quickly and reliably.  The library focuses on flexibility, allowing you to define how you want to interact with logins and logouts.

## Features

React AAD MSAL is a library that allows you to easily integrate auth using Azure Active Directory into your React application.  The library focuses on flexibility, allowing you to define how you want to interact with logins and logouts.

The React AAD MSAL library provides the following features:

* Login using Azure Active Directory
     - create your own function that handles how login (using this AzureAD component) is triggered in your react app
     - create your own function that handles the login success. The AzureAD library will call this function when login is complete to pass back the user info.
* Logout callback
    - create your own function to handle how logout (using this AzureAD component) is triggered in your react app
* Optional use of redux store containing the token and user information returned from Active Directory

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

- `npm install react-aad-msal`

### Quickstart

If you'd like a sample application running, please see the [sample readme](sample/README.md).

To build this component, follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/react-aad-msal.git`
2. `cd ./react-aad-msal`
3. Build the `react-aad-msal` component:
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run build`

## Setup
In the render module of your component, make sure to create an AzureAD component with the arguments you need.  This uses the functions that you will define.  Once the user is successfully authenticated, the component will render the JSX returned by the `authenticatedFunction`, which in this case is called `logoutCallback`.  This is where you should put the secure, user-specific parts of your app.  `loginCallback` and `printUserInfo` can be any user defined functions.

Find the assignment for ClientID and replace the value with the Application ID for your application from the azure portal.  The authority is the sign-in/signup policy for your application.  Graph scopes is a list of scope URLs that you want to grant access to.  You can find more information on the [active directory MSAL single page app azure sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-msal-singlepageapp).

``` jsx
  // ...

  return (
    <AzureAD
      clientID={'<Application ID for your application>'}
      scopes={['<property (i.e. user.read)>', 'https://<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<your-application-name>/<scope (i.e. demo.read)>']}
      unauthenticatedFunction={this.loginCallback}
      authenticatedFunction={this.logoutCallback}
      userInfoCallback={this.printUserInfo}
      authority={'https://login.microsoftonline.com/tfp/<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<your-sign-in-sign-up-policy>'}
      type={LoginType.Popup}
      persistLoginPastSession={true}>
    </AzureAD>
);
```

## Component Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `clientID` | String representing your Azure Active Directory Application ID |
| `scopes` | Array of permission scopes you want to request from the application you are authenticating against. You can see possible [values for this property here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-scopes) |
| `authenticatedFunction` | A user defined callback function for the AzureAD component to consume. This function receives the AzureAD components `logout function` which you can use to trigger a logout |
| `unauthenticatedFunction` | A user defined callback function for the AzureAD component to consume.  This function receives the AzureAD components `login function` which you can then use to trigger a login |
| `userInfoCallback` | A user defined callback function for the AzureAD component to consume. The AzureAD component will call this function when login is complete to pass back the user info in the following format:  <br /><br /> ``` UserInfo { jwtAccessToken: string, jwtIdToken: string, user: Msal.User }```  <br /> <br /> The format of `Msal.User` [can be found here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/dev/docs/classes/_user_.user.html) |
| `authority` | **[Optional]** A string representing your Azure Active Directory application policy. Include if you are trying to authenticate against your Azure Active Directory application. If you're using a B2C AAD, it is usually in the format of: <br/> <br/> `https://login.microsoftonline.com/tfp/<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<your-sign-in-sign-up-policy>` |
| `type` | **[Optional]** `LoginType.Popup` or `LoginType.Redirect`. Redirect is the default if this value is not provided. Make sure to import `LoginType` from the react-aad-msal npm module if using this property  |
| `reduxStore` | **[Optional]** You can provide a redux store which the AzureAD component will dispatch `AAD_LOGIN_SUCCESS` and `AAD_LOGIN_SUCCESS` actions, as well as a `payload` containing `IUserInfo` |
|`persistLoginPastSession`|**[Optional]** A boolean value representing if you want your user to be authenticated after the session ends. If `true` login information will be cached in `LocalStorage`. If `false` login information will be cached in `SessionStorage`. Defaults to `false`.|

## Login
To login, first create a callback function for the AzureAD component to consume.  This function will be called when the component loads, and it will pass in the function to be called when the user wants to login.  In this case, we create a button that will log the user in.

``` jsx
import { AzureAD, LoginType } from 'AzureAD'

loginCallback = (login) => {
  return <button onclick={login}>Login</button>;
};

// ...
```

Once they're logged in, the AzureAD library will call another function given with an `IUserInfo` instance.  You can do whatever you want with this, but you should store it.  In this example, we just print it out to console.

``` javascript
printUserInfo = (userInfo) => {
  console.log(userInfo)
};
```

Once you've set this up, you should be able to set up a button to login that will hit an AAD instance.  To set up your instance, check out the documentation on [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/get-started-azure-ad) and on how to connect an [Identity Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-setup-msa-app) for that AAD instance.

## Logout

Logging out is just as easy.

``` jsx
logoutCallback = (logout) => {
  return (
    <div>
      You're logged in!
      <button onclick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

You can, of course, include a component in either of these functions.  This allows you to gate which view of your application users get, based on whether or not they are authenticated.

## Integrating with a Redux Store

The Azure AD component optionally accepts a ```reduxStore``` prop. On successful login, Azure AD will dispatch an action of type ```AAD_LOGIN_SUCCESS``` to the provided store, containing the token and user information returned from Active Directory. It does the same for logout events, but the action will not contain a payload.

Import your store into the file rendering the AzureAD component and pass it in:

``` jsx
<AzureAD
  reduxStore={store}
  clientID={'<Application ID for your application>'}
  scopes={['<property (i.e. user.read)>', 'https://<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<your-application-name>/<scope (i.e. demo.read)>']}
  unauthenticatedFunction={this.loginCallback}
  authenticatedFunction={this.logoutCallback}
  userInfoCallback={this.printUserInfo}
  authority={'https://login.microsoftonline.com/tfp/<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<your-sign-in-sign-up-policy>'}
  type={LoginType.Popup}
/>
```

Add a case to handle ```AAD_LOGIN_SUCCESS``` and ```AAD_LOGOUT_SUCCESS``` actions in a reducer file:

``` javascript
const initialState = {
  aadResponse: null,
};

const sampleReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'AAD_LOGIN_SUCCESS':
      return { ...state, aadResponse: action.payload };
    case 'AAD_LOGOUT_SUCCESS':
      return { ...state, aadResponse: null};
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## Demo

A sample React-based Single Page Application (SPA) that uses this component is available in the [sample folder](sample/README.md). There you'll find a couple implementations that leverage the library, as well as a tutorial of how to set up Azure Active Directory with an Identity Provider.
